## Tips & Methodology

+ As Data Scientist's we have the opportunity to use [open-source](https://opensource.org/) software to model and communicate ideas across the business. Open-source software is surpassing commercial software due to cost, restriction, feature access and is being adopted by hobbyist for weekend data projects to being used for FDA submissions by researchers.
+ The open source community and its developers are fearlessly passionate about the tools they create and that leads emerging new features, such as new functions for loss functions in xgboost - so it is advantageous to know how to properly interact with the developers of the tools we use (and love) to do our work, request new features, report bugs and submit technical questions.

### Google

+ Google your error!
+ ... or use [http://rseek.org/](http://rseek.org/) which provides some **R** specific resources when searching
+ as always ?FunctionName on Google will not work well as it does in **R**!

### StackOverflow (SO)

+ Interacting on stackoverflow does not require signing up for a account, but you can log in from another Google account to be invovled with the voting process.
+ Before asking a new question make sure that it has not already been answered, in part.
+ The key to writing a great question and recieveing a answer back (without sassy responses) is in creating a [minimal reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example). As Data Scientist's with access to sensitive material it can be hard to generate a minimal example suitable enough for world view, so look at the "native" datasets in the base **R** distribution, and the ever useful `iris` dataset to craft an example to submit to SO. Screenshots of the error can be helpful too for visual defects but the code should support your question fully.

### GitHub

+ same deal as SO, except you will need an account to ask questions, but you will be able to search the repository of the **R** package of interest.
+ questions on GitHub are in the form of submitting a "issue", such as on this link for [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues) which can be categorized and assigned by the developer to prioritize feature request and bug fixes which are linked to specific commits or version of the **R** package or software.
+ Be kind on GitHub as you will have direct access to the developer and they usually are volunteers and have limited time.


### Email & Listserves

+ Also be kind when emailing **R** package developers using personal or academic emails that are provided in the CRAN description for each package.
+ [mailing lists](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html) are another avenue for seeking out help and interacting with the R community.
