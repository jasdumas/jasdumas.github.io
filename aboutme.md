:family_woman_woman_boy_boy: I like long hikes, big data, and cold craft beer. I currently live in Connecticut with my wife, our twin sons and our Scottish Terrier mix dog,
[Fiona](https://twitter.com/jasdumas/status/679480102443417600). When I'm not programming I enjoy visting [covered bridges](https://jasminedaly.com/post_data/ct_covered_bridges_map.nb.html), gardens & arboretums and [growing vegetables](http://hipsterveggies.com/).

I previously worked as a **Senior Data Scientist** ([Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/)), **Data Scientist** ([Simple](https://www.simple.com/)), **Associate Data Scientist** ([The Hartford](https://www.thehartford.com/)), also in **R&D Engineering** roles ([Medtronic](http://www.medtronic.com/covidien) & QDx/Abbott) and as an **Aerospace Manufacturing Engineer** ([AdChem](http://www.acmt.aero/)).

:mortar_board: I earned a Graduate Certificate in **Analytics** at [DePaul University](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/current/Analytics-Certificate.aspx) were I was focused on **Data Mining & Computational Methods**. Previously took **Computer Science courses** at [Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/computer-science) school. Previously earned a Professional Certificate in **Medical Product Development** at [University of California, Irvine Extension](http://ce.uci.edu/areas/life_sciences/medical_products/). Previously earned a BSE in **Biomedical Engineering** from the [University of Hartford](http://www.hartford.edu/ceta/undergraduate/engineering/BM/). My senior research project was to develop a prototype [walk-assist](http://www.tuvie.com/wp-content/uploads/ekso-bionic-suit1.jpg) device for a T4 Paraplegic client; project nicknamed "Iron man". 

:floppy_disk: I like developing open source R software tools to help assist others complete their data analysis work! 

:pencil: I enjoy technical writing and have co-authored two research papers, in [*Connecticut Medicine*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24156174) and [*Bioinformatics*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27503226). [My Erdos number is 6](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/paul-erdos/jasmine-dumas).

:earth_americas: I grew up in the *Lower Hudson Valley, NY* and stayed around *Connecticut* after undergrad. I'm *sometimes* available for *remote consulting* opportunities working with [**diverse** teams](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2015/08/12/the-lack-of-diversity-in-tech-is-a-cultural-issue/#7170290c3577) to solve interesting challenges with data.
