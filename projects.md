## R Packages

* :pencil: [gramr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gramr): This package wraps the command line tool, write-good to provide grammar checking functions for Rmd or md documents. It can be used as an RStudio Addin, or from the console or command line by supplying an .Rmd or .md filename.

* :beers: [ttbbeer](https://github.com/jasdumas/ttbbeer): This is my **first** R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). This package provides the data for materials used at U.S. breweries as listed in the Beer Monthly Statistical Releases. The motivation behind this package was to provide an analysis-ready data set as the original data is in PDF format. [Now available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ttbbeer)

* :globe_with_meridians: [shinyLP](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyLP): This is my **second** R package on CRAN and it provides templates and functions for landing home pages for your shiny application - leading to a better UX for your users and writing less HTML for the developer. [Now available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shinyLP)

* :squirrel: [dumas](https://github.com/jasdumas/dumas): My vanity R package filled with useful functions for data analysis and R development.

## Web Applications / Dashboards

* :microscope: [shinyGEO](http://jasdumas.github.io/shinyGEO/): The Gene Expression Omnibus Analysis with Shiny (Project Name: GEO-AWS) is a web application to download gene expression datasets from the GEO Repository and perform differential expression and survival analyses. This project was partially developed as part of the [2015 Google Summer of Code program](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/jasdumas/5668600916475904) - [Manuscript Publication](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/08/07/bioinformatics.btw519.full.pdf?keytype=ref&ijkey=R1zz4cjrdze0PAC)

* :police_car: [*Flexdashboard* of Reported Crimes in Hartford, Connecticut](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/hartford-crime/): Exploratory Data Analysis and data visualizations (including a interactive `leaflet` map) surrounding public safety questions on data from 2005 to Current from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov) - [blog post](http://jasdumas.github.io/2016-08-22-crime-incidents-hartford/)

* :house_with_garden: [*Flexdashboard* of Connecticut Real Estate Sales](http://jasdumas.github.io/tech-short-papers/flex-realestate.html): Exploratory Data Analysis of Connecticut real estate sales from 2011 to 2013 from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov)  - [Additional RPubs modeling work](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/ct-realestate)

* :earth_africa: [*Flexdashboard* of Estimate Population by Zipcode Choropleth map](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/Choropleth_Zipcodes/): a leaflet map showing the estimated population at a state-level by zipcode of the US.

* :8ball: [*Flexdashboard* of Deep Learning Image Classification with Keras](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/image_clf/): This application uses the ResNet50 model, with weights pre-trained on ImageNet to enable fast experimentation for prediction of uploaded images classes.

## Media

* :dollar: [R for FinTech](https://jasdumas.github.io/r4fintech/): A in-progress guidebook written in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) for R programming with Financial Technology (FinTech) applications.

* :speaker: [RTalk Podcast](https://twitter.com/RTalkPodcast): I co-hosted a technical podcast on the statistical software and programming language R with some buddies in the community. [Old Episodes on available iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/r-talk/id1030819337?mt=2)

## Tutorials

* :carrot: [Hipster Veggies](https://github.com/jasdumas/hipster-veggies): Find Select Trending Vegetables from Twitter using the `rtweet` and `tidyverse` packages

* :us: [The Republic](https://github.com/jasdumas/the-republic): Local Connecticut Election & Voter Data Analytics Projects

* :robot: [Extracting data from Twitter to get Chris Albon's Machine Learning Flashcards](https://github.com/jasdumas/ml-flashcards): [Blog post](https://jasdumas.github.io/2017-05-02-twitter-ml-flashcards/); [_also support Chris and buy the flashcards_](https://store.chrisalbon.com/courses/machine-learning-flashcards)

* :beer: [Web scraping and mapping breweries with import.io and R](http://trendct.org/2016/03/18/tutorial-web-scraping-and-mapping-breweries-with-import-io-and-r/): Getting information on Breweries can be a difficult process with data from multiple sources or sources that have limited access to developers. Import.io instantly turns webpages into data with minimal or no set-up involved. I developed this tutorial to extract meta data on Connecticut-based breweries.

* :tomato: [Web Scraping the Best of Rotten Tomatoes](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/rotten-tomatoes): Using the `rvest` package, I web scraped several "best of" film genres lists into a a table and provided a `plotly` data visualization to understand ratings versus reviews.



## Other Projects

* :umbrella: [Insurance Claim Complaints](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/eda-ct-insurance): Exploratory Data Analysis of Connecticut insurance company complaints, resolutions, status, and recoveries from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov)

* :deciduous_tree: [Virtual Bioinformatics Notebook](https://github.com/jasdumas/DouglasFir): I spent a few great months gaining informatics skills at the [University of Connecticut](http://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/) (UCONN) working on the genomics of big trees and walnuts.

* :snake: [My solved Project Euler problems](https://github.com/jasdumas/LeonhardEuler): For fun I like to stretch my mathematical and python knowledge and attempt to solve these famous problems.

* :milky_way: [Star Wars 2048 Game](http://jasdumas.github.io/2048/): This project involved conceptualizing a re-design for the popular web application game 2048. In my version, I gave it a much needed Star Wars upgrade where the objective is to achieve the highest square of Yoda!

* :parking: [Exploring Towed car data in Hartford, CT during a snow storm](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/hartford-snow-tows): Exploratory Data Analysis of a dataset from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov) which tracked cars that were towed during and after a snow storm in Winter 2015.
